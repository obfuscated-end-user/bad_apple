# Bad Apple!!
"[Bad Apple!!](https://youtu.be/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8)" rendered on the terminal using Python. Yes, [two exclamation marks](https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/6u5evk/how_come_double_exclamation_marks_are_so_common). Runs on Python 3.11.5, 64-bit.  
Technically, this can render any YouTube video, just don't expect it to work without (minor) issues.
